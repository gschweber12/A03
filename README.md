•	Branch – a parallel version of a repository where it is possible to make changes safely and try new ideas without damaging previous work.
•	Clone – creates a copy of a repository on your local machine.
•	Commit – an individual change or a group of changes to a file.
•	Fetch – downloads the content from a remote repository.
•	Git- a version control system that tracks changes in files.
•	Github – An open source version control system that is used to keep track of changes and allow multiple people to work on the same document at the same time.
•	Merge – Takes the changes from one branch and applies them to another.
•	Merge conflict – When changes between merging branches override each other. In order for the merge conflict to be settled and the merge complete the user must choose the changes they want to keep.
•	Push – sends the current version of the local repository to the remote repository and update it to the state of the local repository.
•	Pull – sends the current version of the remote repository to the local repository and update it to the state of the remote repository.
•	Remote – A remote repository is a repository that is not on your local computer. A remote repository would be one that is on Github.
•	Repository – contains all of the project’s files and each file’s revision history.
